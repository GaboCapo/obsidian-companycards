# Obsidian Contacts Plugin
Introducing the [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) Contacts Plugin! With this plugin, you can easily organize and manage your contacts within [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). Simply create a note with contact information and use the plugin's features to quickly search, filter, and sort through your contacts.

## Usage
After enabling the plugin in the settings menu, you should see the contacts button appear in the left sidebar. Click it to open the Contacts view in the right sidebar.

The plugin reads your contacts folder, which can be changed in the settings, to render all your contacts in the right sidebar.

### Changing the Contacts Folder
1. Go to the settings.
1. Find the "Contacts" tab.
1. Change the value of "Contacts Folder Location" to an existing folder.
